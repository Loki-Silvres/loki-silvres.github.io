### <a href="https://github.com/Loki-Silvres/Warehouse-Drone">[Code]</a>

This project focuses on developing an autonomous **Warehouse Drone** for the **e-Yantra 2023-24 competition**, leveraging advanced techniques in navigation, control systems, and simulation. The drone is designed to autonomously navigate a confined warehouse environment, localize itself, and perform tasks efficiently.
