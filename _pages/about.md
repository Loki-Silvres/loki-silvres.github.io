I am a researcher focused on **Robotic Perception and Computer Vision**. My work centers on vision-based models applied to multi-agent systems and autonomous vehicles, aiming to create adaptive robots that combine advanced perception, learning, and control mechanisms. My goal is to advance robot intelligence through vision transformers and machine learning techniques that enable autonomous decision-making in dynamic environments. 

I am currently a **CS undergraduate** at **IIT Dhanbad**, India. Most recently, I have been working as a research intern at [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion (MARMoT) Lab, NUS](https://www.marmotlab.org/index.html) under [Prof. Guillaume A. Sartoretti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n7NzZ0sAAAAJ&hl=fr), focusing on Visual Active Search using Vision-Language Models and Reinforcement Learning. I have also had the pleasure of working under the mentorship of [Prof. Subhrangsu Mandal](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=4Uc5kc0AAAAJ&hl=en) at IIT Dhanbad, and I was also fortunate to complete an internship at Clutterbot Technologies Pvt. Ltd. in Bangalore, where I worked on improving baseline vision models through knowledge distillation and self-training with foundation models.
